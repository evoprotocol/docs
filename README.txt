%==============================================================================


The evoPROTOCOL program is a utility for making volumetric global 
dynamic changes to a crypto-based asset.  It is useful for changing 
a price dynamics, and is designed for typical ERC-20 compliant assets. 

This program was written in 2020 and worked well in MacOS 10.13.  
It works in Macintosh operating systems earlier than MacOS 10.13. 
I have no plans to upgrade this software for more recent versions 
of the Macintosh operating system.
